Here you’ll find short answers to "How do I...?" types of questions. These
how-to guides don’t cover topics in depth --- you’ll find that material in the
topic guides and the API Reference. However, these guides will help you quickly
accomplish common tasks.

more flexibility than the standard ASTRA-toolbox geometries. They do not contain
